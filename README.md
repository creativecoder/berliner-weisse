## Recipes and Techniques

**Fementables**

- 50% Wheat Malt
- 50% Pilsner

**Hops**

- A low amount of a nobel hop
- Try 0.5 oz for a 5 gal batch, either added to decoction mash or first wort hopping

**Mash**

- Tripple decoction mash is traditional
- Can use a single decoction instead
  - Mash in at protein rest temperature (122 ˚F)
  - Decoction
    - Pull thick decoction
    - Raise to 150 ˚F and hold for 5-10 min for saccharification
    - Raise to boiling and hold for 5 min (keep the boil short to avoid color development)
  - Add decoction back to main mash to raise mash temp to 148-152 ˚F for 30-60 min
  - Raise mash to 168 ˚F to mash out

**Boil**

- Traditionally beer is not boiled
- Modern santitation practices recommend bringing the wort up to a boil, then chilling to fermentation temperature

**Souring**

Traditionally brewed with a combination of Lactobacillus and yeast, traditionally in a 5:1 ratio

There are a few techniques you can use to sour this beer

Mash or kettle souring

Pitch a blended culture

Lacto starter

Lactobacillus is most active at about 100 ˚F, so you can
- Pitch both yeast and lactobacillus at a lower temperature and let the sour develop over a long aging period
- Pitch the lactobacillus first, at a higher temperature, then bring the temperature down and add brewing yeast
  - But don't wait too long to add the yeast (no more than 2-3 days)... some brewing yeast doesn't do very well in the high acidity created by lactobacillus
- (you could also try a 100% lactobacillus beer, if you have a strong enough culture

**Available cultures**
