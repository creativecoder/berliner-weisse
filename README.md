## History

(from Brewing with Wheat, p150-154)

- What we today call "Berliner Weiss" evolved from several different brewing practices and variations.
- It is widely believed that the term "weiss", meaning white, was used in the past to distinguish pale wheat beer from its darker contemporaries.
- The earliest reference to the beer is from a special tax was established on Berlin's weissbier in 1680. But nothing indicates that Berlin's wheat beer was any different from any other "white" beer in the region at the time, and there's no mention of the sour, lactic flavors we associate with the style today.
- When sourness was associated with the style, it wasn't always considered desirable. In 1765, at least some brewers were trying to find a way to make a white beer that would not turn sour.
- It seems the beer was always kept as light as possible, using air-dried or lightly kilned malts and little or no boiling of the wort.
- Until the 1860s, smoked wheat malt was used to brew Berliner weiss, until one brewer experimented with an unsmoked version that was received so well that other brewers quickly followed.
- Today the beer is traditionally consumed with a dash of rasberry juice or woodruff syrup.

**Stats**

Name     | Range
-------: | :----
**IBUs** | 3-8

## Ingredients

**Fementables**

- Malt bill consists of wheat and pilsner malts
- Use a high percentage of wheat, from 25-60%

**Hops**

- Use a low amount of any German nobel hop
- Can be added to mash (particulary useful to add to boiled decoction, if decoction mashing)
- Can also be first wort hopped or boiled
- Keep the hopping low--most strains of Lactobacillus are inhibited by hop acid

**Mash**

- Tripple decoction mash is traditional
- Can use a single decoction or even infusion to save time
- Example mash schedule
  - Mash in at protein rest temperature (122 ˚F) for 10-30 min
  - Decoction
    - Pull thick decoction
    - Raise to 150 ˚F and hold for 5-10 min for saccharification
    - Raise to boiling and hold for 5 min (keep the boil short to avoid color development)
  - Add decoction back to main mash to raise mash temp to 148-152 ˚F for 30-60 min
  - Raise mash to 168 ˚F to mash out

**Boil**

- Traditionally beer is not boiled
- Modern santitation practices recommend bringing the wort up to a boil, then chilling to fermentation temperature
- Some brewers boil for 5-30 min, to ensure sanitation

**Sourness**

You need to get Lacto from somewhere. You can:

1. Pitch a commercial Lactobacillus culture
2. Cultivate it yourself: lacto grows on lots of things, including malt!

You need to introduce lacto into the wort. You can:

1. Sour the mash
2. Sour the kettle
3. Pitch Lactobacillus 

Lacto starters

- Can be made with malt/malt extract or with apple juice.
- Keep them warm, 95-105 ˚F for the most growth
- Oxygen is not needed, so skip the stir plate
- A yogurt maker is a great tool for cultivating a lacto starter, if you have one, since it's made to hold the temperature at ~100 ˚F



Traditionally brewed with a combination of Lactobacillus and yeast, traditionally in a 5:1 ratio

There are a few techniques you can use to sour this beer

Mash or kettle souring

Pitch a blended culture

Lacto starter

Lactobacillus is most active at about 100 ˚F, so you can
- Pitch both yeast and lactobacillus at a lower temperature and let the sour develop over a long aging period
- Pitch the lactobacillus first, at a higher temperature, then bring the temperature down and add brewing yeast
  - But don't wait too long to add the yeast (no more than 2-3 days)... some brewing yeast doesn't do very well in the high acidity created by lactobacillus
- (you could also try a 100% lactobacillus beer, if you have a strong enough culture

Brettanomyces

- German brewing scientists believe that Brettanomyces is essential to get the correct flavor profile, but this character is never strong.
- Some commercial yeast/lacto blends include Brett
- This flavor will become more promenant the longer the beer ages

**Examples from Professional Breweries**

Berliner-Kindl-Schultheiss in Germany
(Brewing with Wheat p 155-156)

- 25% wheat malt
- Split the wort into halves
- One half is not boiled, not hopped, and infused with Lactobacillus (80 liters for 800 hectoliters) for primary fermentation
- The other half is boiled with the tiniest portion of hops and primary fermentation done with Saccharomyces (brewing yeast)
- Primary fermentation for 1 week, starting at 59 ˚F and rising to 77 ˚F
- Both halves are combined and cold condition for secondary fermentation

Nodding Head Brewery
(Brewing with Wheat p 166-168)

- 40% wheat malt
- Single infusion mash
- Boils wort for 10 min
- Pitches a blend of yeast and Lactobacillus
- Primary fermentation for 2-3 days, conditioning for 5-6 weeks
